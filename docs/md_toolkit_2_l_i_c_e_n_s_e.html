<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md39"></a>
Liability</h1>
<p>The parties shall be liable to each other for direct and indirect property damage and financial loss caused by them, their legal representatives or vicarious agents or third parties engaged by them, in particular subcontractors, in accordance with the following provisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Consortium shall only be liable for intent and gross negligence – except in the case of breach of essential contractual obligations, injury to life, limb or health or in the case of claims arising from legislation. Essential contractual obligations are those whose fulfilment is necessary to achieve the purpose of the contract (i.e. delivery of the TUPLES competition).</li>
<li>The user shall be exclusively liable for breaches of duty by the user, in particular in the event of infringement of third-party trademarks, copyrights and rights to a name. The user indemnifies the Consortium from all claims for payment of other users and third parties, which are asserted against the Consortium due to an infringement of rights by the contents posted for a user and / or due to the use of the platform by the user.</li>
<li>The user shall bear all reasonable costs incurred by the Consortium resulting from such an infringement upon first request. This includes in particular the necessary costs of legal defence. This shall not apply if the user is not responsible for the infringement. Other claims of the Consortium against the user remain unaffected.</li>
<li>The availability of the platform may be temporarily restricted in whole or in part due to technical disruptions for which The Consortium is not responsible or for reasons of force majeure (e.g. power supply and or internet failure, fire, explosion, earthquake, storm, flooding, industrial action for which The Consortium is not responsible), furthermore due to the performance of maintenance work which serves to maintain and improve the reliability and functionality of the platform.</li>
<li>Consortium members are entitled to take legal action against the user at their general place of jurisdiction. </li>
