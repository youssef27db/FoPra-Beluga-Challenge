Essential contractual obligations are those whose fulfilment is necessary to achieve the purpose of the contract (i.e. delivery of the TUPLES competition).

- The user shall be exclusively liable for breaches of duty by the user, in particular in the event of infringement of third-party trademarks, copyrights and rights to a name.

This shall not apply if the user is not responsible for the infringement. Other claims of the Consortium against the user remain unaffected.
